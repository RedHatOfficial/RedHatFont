  <description>
    <p>Red Hat Typeface is a fresh take on the geometric sans genre,
       taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs
       including Tempo and Highway Gothic.
    </p>
    <p>The Display styles, made for headlines and big statements,
       are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters.
    </p>
    <p>The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher / Pentagram
       and designed by Jeremy Mickel / MCKL for the new Red Hat identity.
