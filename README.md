## About Red Hat Display and Red Hat Text

<img src='type-specimen@2x.png' width='752' height='393' />

Red Hat is an enterprise software company with an open source development model. We use collaboration and knowledge sharing to craft better, more reliable, and more adaptable technologies. How our words look is as important to our brand voice as the words we choose. That’s why we developed a type family that’s all our own.

The Red Hat type family is produced in 2 optical sizes, in a range of weights with italics. The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher / Pentagram and designed by Jeremy Mickel / MCKL for the new Red Hat identity.

Red Hat is a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic. The Display styles, made for headlines and big statements, are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.

As part of Red Hat’s commitment to open source software, the fonts are made available for use under the SIL Open Font License.
